# DiceCalculator
A somewhat complex console app that calculates the most likely outcome of a dice roll. Inspired by the [10,000 rolls tool](http://artish-stuff.de/test/10000rolls.html), this app provides precise results. Be warned, though: calculations increase exponentially. Large rolls could take a long time.
